Fertility Diagnosis_Dataset_Using_MachineLearning
Completed this project as part of my Data Science and Machine Learning Internship with United Network of Professionals (UNP).

Key highlights:

1.Studied and Analyzed the fertility diagnosis dataset to applying ML models and present my insights.

2.Performed various Exploratory Data Analysis to understand the data and compared the variables.

3.Experimented with different Machine Learning algorithms, Logistic Regression, Neural Networks, Bagging, Decision tree,Random forest,KNN and Boosting,SVM.

4.Compared the results to recommend the best Classification model.
